Array-3 > fix34

Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array,
but rearranged so that every 3 is immediately followed by a 4.  Do not move the 3's, but every other number may move.
The array contains the same number of 3's and 4's, every 3 has a number after it that is not a 3,
and a 3 appears in the array before any 4.
