Recursion-1 > count8

Given a non-negative int n, compute recursively (no loops) the count of the occurrences of 8 as a digit,
except that an 8 with another 8 immediately to its left counts double, so 8818 yields 4.
Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6),
while divide (/) by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).

count8(8) == 1
count8(818) == 2
count8(8818) == 4
