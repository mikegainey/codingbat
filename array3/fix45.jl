Array-3 > fix45

(This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.)
Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array,
but rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5.
Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move.
The array contains the same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4.
In this version, 5's may appear anywhere in the original array.

fix45([5, 4, 9, 4, 9, 5]) == [9, 4, 5, 4, 5, 9]
fix45([1, 4, 1, 5]) == [1, 4, 5, 1]
fix45([1, 4, 1, 5, 5, 4, 1]) == [1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 4, 5]
